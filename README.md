*NPC*

A compiler project written in c, the language is called np (not pascal), its supposed to be similar to c in terms of machine distance. However, it should provide features that make programming easier.
You can find multiple examples of code under ./programs


*GOALS*

| - | ----------------- |
| - [ ] | Low level (C style) |
| - [ ] | Simplicity (C style) |

*Done:*

- Scanner

*In progress:*
- Documentation
- Parser
  
*Todo:*
- Ir generation
- Code optimization
- Code generation
- (Peephole optimizations)

Any contributions in any way appreciated.

How to:
- recommended way to contribute is via vscode in windows with wsl or simply in linux. If you want to use another IDE do so as you wish though. The advantages are that the workflow is setup already.
- the settings and extensions are provided in .vscode

Would really appreciate to see a pull request from you
