*NPC*

A compiler project written in c, the language is called np (not pascal), its a weird mix between C and scripting languages.
You can find an example of code based upon the grammar under ./src/test_program.npc.

The progress has stalled since 2022 but i will maybe resume at some point.
The compiler is able to produce a tree of lexemes and a symbol table based upon a specific grammar (code).

*Done:*

- Documentation
- Scanner
- Parser
  
*Todo:*
- Ir generation
- Code optimization

- (Peephole optimizations)
